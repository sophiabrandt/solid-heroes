Simple SolidJS example with GraphQL-Yoga.

See [Jack Herrington's YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZc2hSghezM) for details.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies. I use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io), but you can easily use yarn or npm.

Run the server:

```bash
cd server
pnpm install
pnpm run start
```

Run the client:

```bash
cd client
pnpm install
pnpm run start
```
